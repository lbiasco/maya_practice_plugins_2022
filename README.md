# maya_practice_plugins_2022
Various plug-ins for Autodesk Maya written for practice with the Maya API and C++

My goal is to write a plugin for each of the example types provided in the 2020 developer docs: commands, tools, nodes, translators, shaders, manipulators, dynamic fields, dynamic emitters, dynamic springs, and shapes. As this is mostly for practice, the plugins will probably be fairly simple, and I may not end up completing one of each example type.
